## About Azure DevOps + IaC Hackathon

Who doesn't love a good hackathon?, DevOps is a journey, not a destination. Our goal when writing this challenged based hack is to introduce you to the Azure DevOps tooling and some common DevOps practices.

Our intent was to select an Azure Architecture with interconnected resources, separated in Tiers, and implemented concepts of modular programming, with an emphasis on showing how Azure DevOps can help you on your DevOps journey so that you can apply this in your environments.
