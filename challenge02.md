[Back](challenge01.md) - [Home](README.md) - [Next](challenge03.md)

### Introduction

Historically version control has been the first component that teams have implemented, it is one of the oldest and most well understood components of DevOps. Please take a moment to review the basics of version control, specially focusing on the distributed version control technology, Git.

1. [What is version control?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/git/what-is-version-control)
2. [What is Git?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/git/what-is-git)
3. [What is Azure Repo?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/get-started/what-is-repos?view=azure-devops)

3. After seeing the Reference Diagram, Discuss its advantages and disadvantages. What folder structure will you implement?.

### Challenge

Now that we have a basic understanding of version control and Git, let's get some code checked into source control. 

1. When you created your project in Azure DevOps, it created a default repository for you in Azure Repos. Initialize Azure Repo.([hint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/project-vision-status?view=azure-devops#initialize-a-readme-file-for-a-git-repo)).
2. Clone this repo to your local computer ([hint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/clone?view=azure-devops&tabs=visual-studio)).
3. Create Folder Structure.


### Success Criteria

1. You should be able to go to the Azure DevOps site and under Azure Repos see your folder structure.
2. You should be able to have the Azure Repo clone in your machine.
